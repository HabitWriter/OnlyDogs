# OnlyDogs
 A place for pawsitivity and furever friends.

 And most importantly it's ONLY FOR DOGS!

 ## About the Project

### Why did you make this?
 Dogs are an underserved market when it comes to social media. We're looking to reinvent the way in which dogs connect and communicate. We're trying to provide a modern alternative to the fire hydrant and the dog park.

 ### The techy bits

 OnlyDogs is built on the PERN stack. With helpful tools from Lodash, Jotai for global state, and sequelize as an ORM.

 We also used Tailwind and Daisy UI for design which was really awesome to build with. Gave us experience with tailwind and UI libraries.

 ### Struggles

 We have wrestled a lot with firebase and socket.io. We're hoping to use these technologies to build out all of the remaining features for OnlyDogs

 ## How to Run OnlyDogs

 OnlyDogs is built on the Pern stack. You'll need to have Postgres.

 Here are some useful commands:

 ```npm run seed```

 this will seed the database.

 Other than that, use standard commands to run it in the browser.

 I may add more here in the future.

 ## How Should I Use OnlyDogs

 If you're a dog, use it however you like. If you aren't then GET OUT!

 ## Next Steps

 We'd really like to implement the following features:

**Working Chat**
We'd like to get chats working in the future to facilitate dog communication

**Friends Functionality**
We're hoping to implement better connection with friends

**More Robust Likes System** While we are fans of unending positivity, we can make some progress on the likes system.
